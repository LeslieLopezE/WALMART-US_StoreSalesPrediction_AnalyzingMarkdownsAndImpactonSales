# WALMART's Store Sales Prediction : Analyzing WALMART's in-store markdowns and their impact on sales in different seasonal and macroeconomic conditions in US

Executive Summary

Background.-
The U.S. Food and Grocery Industry Subsector represents $1.46B in revenue in 2020. Walmart is the biggest retailer in this subsector with $300M and operates under a Every Day Low Price Strategy (EDLP). Therefore, it has scaled its business to support ELDP. In contrast, competitors operate a high-low pricing strategy.

This study focuses on the retail food and grocery subsector, which sells a full line of grocery items, including meat, produce, natural & organics, deli & bakery, dairy, frozen foods, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, floral and dry grocery, as well as consumables such as health and beauty aids, baby products, household chemicals, paper goods and pet supplies (Walmart Inc.). For this purpose, in-store sales of the world’s highest-turnover company, Walmart Inc. (MarketLine), which is headquartered in the United States, will be analyzed.

The U.S. Retail Industry contributes significantly to the U.S. economy with revenues representing 19.4% of the U.S. GDP in 2020 (See Figure 1). Competition in the food and grocery industry is intrinsically stiff and inherently characterized by small profit margins. Retailers, including the leader, Walmart, need to continuously improve their ability to compete in the industry, where pricing and promotion remain critical to retain customers.  This research study will uncover business insights that can be used to further optimize Walmart’s markdown strategy in generating sales growth.


Problem Statement.-
While Walmart is successful in its EDLP strategy, understanding the impact of markdowns, specifically during market conditions driven by external factors such as holidays, temperature, fuel prices, and other macroeconomic factors, will be of great value for Walmart to uncover business insights that can be used to further optimize sales growth.


Research objective.-
The objective of this study is to analyze and assess the impact and effectiveness of Walmart’s markdowns in increasing sales revenue during conditions affected by macroeconomic factors and seasonality. 


Data and the model.-
The data sets were originally provided by Walmart for recruiting purposes and contain weekly sales data for the period of February 2010 to July 2013 and from 45 stores located in different regions in the U.S. The sets include internal dimensions like store size, type, price markdown, along with external variables such as temperature, holidays, unemployment rate, etc, While the data is 8 years old, the brick-and-mortar business dynamics can still be applicable to today’s market condition. A multiple linear regression model was developed and evaluated.


Major findings and conclusions.-
The results of correlation and regression analysis revealed that the relationship between sales and seasonality, holidays, markdowns, consumer price index and unemployment are muted because of Walmart’s EveryDay Low-Price Strategy (EDLP). Therefore, Walmart must focus on continuing its EDLP strategy and disregard markdowns implemented across all categories at once.
This research recommends implementing further research at more granular level, since sales are driven by seasonal and macroeconomic factors for each product category and not as an aggregate (total sales).

Implications for business analytics managers.-
One key limitation of this study is the aggregated nature of weekly sales. The recommendation to shift markdown investment to other potentially more impactful programs and focus on EDLP serves as a practical example for managers and executives to dispassionately weigh data against pre-conceived ideas. The assumption that markdowns, CPI, unemployment, holidays, and fuel prices have ‘obvious’ impact on sales is a strong bias to look for confirmation. 

Limitations of the study.-
The data acquired from Walmart is more than 5 years old. Since then, significant market changes have occurred that could shape this research differently. The outbreak of Covid-19 inadvertently affected retail dynamics like channel preference (i.e., online), product mix (e.g., in-home dining might increase demand for home-cooked food), pricing considering unemployment rates, and many other factors. Expansion of online channel and specifically Amazon’s rise in the past 5 years could materially impact the findings of this paper as well as pricing, product, supply chain, and other changes that may have been implemented by Walmart within this period.
